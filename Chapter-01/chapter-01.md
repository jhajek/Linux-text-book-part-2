### 1.1 Tools of Troubleshooting 

1.1.1 - Measure CPU usage

1.1.2 - Measure memory usage

1.1.3 - Measure disk I/O

1.1.4 - Measure network I/O

1.1.5 - Measure firewalling and routing throughput

1.1.6 - Map client bandwidth usage

1.1.7 - Match / correlate system symptoms with likely problems

1.1.8 - Estimate throughput and identify bottlenecks in a system including networking

### 1.2 Predict Future Resource Needs

1.2.1 - Use collectd to monitor IT infrastructure usage

1.2.2 - Predict capacity break point of a configuration

1.2.3 - Observe growth rate of capacity usage

1.2.4 - Graph the trend of capacity usage

1.2.5 - Awareness of monitoring solutions such as Nagios, MRTG and Cacti

1.2.6 - Monitoring tools such as Ganglia and Vector
