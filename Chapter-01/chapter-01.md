### Section 1.0 Setup and Introduction

### 1.1 Tools of Troubleshooting 

1.1.1 - Measure CPU usage

top c
htop
atop
cat /proc/cpuinfo

netstat
pstree
ps
w
lsof
uptime
sar

1.1.2 - Measure memory usage
memfree
cat /proc/meminfo
top m
vmstat

1.1.3 - Measure disk I/O
iostat

1.1.4 - Measure network I/O
netstat 

1.1.5 - Measure firewalling and routing throughput


1.1.6 - Map client bandwidth usage


1.1.7 - Match / correlate system symptoms with likely problems
uptime
1.1.8 - Estimate throughput and identify bottlenecks in a system including networking

### 1.2 Predict Future Resource Needs

1.2.1 - Use collectd to monitor IT infrastructure usage

1.2.2 - Predict capacity break point of a configuration

1.2.3 - Observe growth rate of capacity usage

1.2.4 - Graph the trend of capacity usage

1.2.5 - Awareness of monitoring solutions such as Nagios, MRTG and Cacti

1.2.6 - Monitoring tools such as Ganglia and Vector
