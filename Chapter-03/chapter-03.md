#Free and Opensource Server Operating System Families
![*This really is a true story, and she doesn't know I put it in my comic because her wifi hasn't worked for weeks.*](images/Chapter-Header/chapter-03/cautionary.png "XKCD Cautionary")

__Chapter Objectives__

  *  Define Opensource Server Operating system families and know their history
  *  Understand the history of these families
  *  Understand how to install various types of opensource operating systems
  *  Be able to evaluate strengths and weaknesses to suit enterprise needs
  *  Understand the similarities and differences between UNIX and Linux
  
__Outcomes__
 
At the conclusion of this lecture you will have an understanding of contemporary FOSS server-based operating systems. You will be able to compare and contrast strengths and weaknesses of all types of OSes from BSD to Linux to IllumOS (Unix).

   
## FOSS Operating system category definition

### Linux

* Started in 1991 by Linus Torvalds
* Linux is NOT an operating system - it is just a kernel.
* Released under GPLv2
* By circa 2000 commercial Linux companies begin to take off
* Largest and most powerful is RedHat
* Debian project starts at this time - but is unique because it is not commercially backed.
* Mascot is the penguin named Tux

### Redhat Linux

  First billion dollar Linux commercial company--proving that opensource can make money.
  
  It's a family of operating systems actually 
  
  Powerful company--perhaps positioning themselves to take over the entire commercial Linux environment.
  
  All it's source code is freely available via the GPLv2 (it has to be--that is the nature of opensource).
 
#### Fedora Project

* Release every 6 to 12 months
* Bleeding edge
* Only supports last two rolling releases
* Not ideal for basing a business on -> Why?
* Good for testing an iterating technology quickly

#### RHEL-Redhat Enterprise Linux

 * Point in time snapshot of Fedora project
 * Provides long term stable support (6 years)
 * Companies can base their business on this because of stability promise
 * Fedora 19 & 20 were the basis for RHEL 7 & 7.2 
 * 10 years support
 * Main Redhat stream of income
 * Licenses, packages, and support

#### CentOS

*  Since all of RHEL source code has to be opensoruced (by nature of GPLv2) anyone could download it and legally reissue it
*  Centos did that with all the logos changed
*  Not an actual company - volunteer group
*  Wanted RHEL stability but with desktop software/feature updates quicker
*  Release pegged to RHEL
*  Originally Redhat fought them as a competitor taking money, but realized now that they should welcome CentOS in and just offer service contracts to their customers

#### Scientific Linux

* Same as CentOS 
* Created as a collaboration between Fermi Lab and CERN
* Scientific Linux offers wireless and Bluetooth out of the box
* comes with a comprehensive range of software, such as multimedia codecs, Samba, and Compiz
* Prepare for a common national laboratory environment

#### Oracle Linux (Unbreakable Linux)

* 2006 Oracle realized that their database software was being run on RHEL predominantly
* Realized that they could just use the RHEL software (open source) and repackage it to run with Oracle products and Java
* Then sell support to those potential ex-Redhat customers and even current Redhat customers
* Added a new filesystem, Btrfs to Linux as a GPLv2 copy of ZFS--but not quite ready for production.

### Debian based Family

Three major branches of this family.  

*  Debian 
*  Ubuntu
*  Devuan

#### Debian

* Initial release September of 1993
* NOT a commercially back Linux - volunteer based
* Oldest Linux project still in active development
* Founder (Ian Murdock) recently passed away.
* Introduced the "killer app" of early Linux - package management APT
* Allowed for software to be easily installed through one central dependency manager/structure
* Debian was founded on the open source "rights" guaranteeing these for it's community -- over commercial opportunities
* Over 100+ Debian based derivative distros
